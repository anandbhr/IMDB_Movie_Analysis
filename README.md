# IMDB_Movie_Analysis

## Project Description

This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of IMDb_Movies dataset. A potential problem to investigate could be: "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?" Here, success can be defined by high IMDB ratings. The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects.

Here exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the relationships between different variables. The correlation between movie ratings and other factors like genre, director, budget, etc. can be analyzed. It is also good to consider the year of release, the actors involved, and other relevant factors.
